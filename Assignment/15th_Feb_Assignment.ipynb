        "### Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
        "The multiprocessing package supports spawning processes. It refers to a function that loads and executes a new child processes. For the child to terminate or to continue executing concurrent computing,then the current process has to wait using an API, which is similar to threading module.\n",
        "\n",
        "The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.\n"

        "While multithreading and multiprocessing can both be used to increase the computing power of a system, there are some key differences between these approaches. Here are some of the primary ways these methods differ from one another:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Multiprocessing uses two or more CPUs to increase computing power, whereas multithreading uses a single process with multiple code segments to increase computing power.\n",
        "2. Multithreading focuses on generating computing threads from a single process, whereas multiprocessing increases computing power by adding CPUs.\n",
        "3. Multiprocessing is used to create a more reliable system, whereas multithreading is used to create threads that run parallel to each other.\n",
        "4. multithreading is quick to create and requires few resources, whereas multiprocessing requires a significant amount of time and specific resources to create.\n",
        "5. Multiprocessing executes many processes simultaneously, whereas multithreading executes many threads simultaneously.\n",
        "6. Multithreading uses a common address space for all the threads, whereas multiprocessing creates a separate address space for each process."
