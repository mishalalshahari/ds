Pairwise deletion involves excluding any participant who has missing data from the analysis of that particular variable, which can result in reduced power and biased estimates if the data are not missing completely at random. Mean substitution involves replacing the missing values with the mean of the observed values, which can also result in biased estimates if the data are not missing completely at random. Maximum likelihood estimation is a more sophisticated method that estimates the missing data based on the available data, assuming a specific distribution of the data.
